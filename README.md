# CS-Bot-Meetup-2016-11

An new class of "smart speakers" is heralding a revolution in how we interact with our devices. Windows 10 comes with Cortana, iPhone 7 was released with a smarter Siri  and we will soon see Google Assistant in our Android Phones. 

You can join this revolution. Microsoft Cognitive Services and Bot Framework let you build apps with powerful algorithms using just a few lines of code. They work across devices and platforms such as iOS, Android, and Windows, keep improving, and are easy to set up.

You will learn about Bot Framework, Emotion API, Face API, Computer Vision API, Video API as well as Text to Speech / Speech to Text and Language Understanding Intelligent Service (LUIS).
